### How to Deploy on Supported Platforms

**Google Sites:** Not directly compatible (Google Sites uses its own editor). 
Use this as your design reference, then rebuild in Google Sites.

**Canva / Wix / Strikingly:** This is a standalone HTML/CSS/JS file. 
If your teacher requires these platforms, use this as a reference for content and design.

**For direct submission (if allowed):** Host on GitHub Pages (free):
1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Create a new repository.
3. Upload all files.
4. Go to Settings → Pages → Source: main branch.
5. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name`.
